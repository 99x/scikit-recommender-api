#Scikit API

Official page at [https://99xt.github.io/scikit-api/](https://99xt.github.io/scikit-api/).

## Overview
Scikit API is a professionally-crafted state-of-art recommender system API service which runs as a simplified web service. It is based on popular python machine learning library known as [Scikit-learn](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/ ). As the  entire service is developed inside a [Docker container](https://hub.docker.com/r/99xt/scikit-api/), anyone can easily up and run the service without worrying about underlying infrastructure or low level details.

SciKit API is highly recommended to be used as a boilerplate for beginners in Docker Services, Machine Learning and Application Development using AngularJS2. 

Currently it’s under development and all are welcome to contribute!
